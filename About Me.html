<h3>Hey names Boston Cruz Ruiz my favorite things are gaming on game systems and looking at YouTube videos. Some of the things I like to do are play video games in my free time and watch videos on YouTube/ Internet. Last I really like to Listen to music one of the songs I like to listen to the most is called devil trigger from the game: Devil May Cry 5 the games ost is fantastic. Another game ost I like to listen to is The World Ends With You the two songs are calling and long dream it's a good game you should try it if you own a modded 3ds or Nintendo Switch. I also like to try to code in my free time when I'm bored and on YouTube I'm still looking for a job at the moment but sooner or later I'll get one. Also, I'm trying to be Either a voice actor or a cover song singer. My favorite anime is: JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and Yugioh I like all the seasons that these shows have to offer. My favorite horror movies are all the Saw movies Nightmare on elm street movies and anything that looks good my favorite food is Honestly, anything that's not healthy like fast food and take out. Last I don’t have any aspirations the only aspiration I got is to make sure that that I’m alive and being financially stable I’m not really a tradesmen. I was just drop in this school and decided to stay for the long haul because why not maybe this school might not be that bad it’s more or less in the middle for me there’s things I love about this school and a lot of things I absolutely hate but both of the list are too long and also because I don’t think the school wouldn’t like what's on my list.</h3>
