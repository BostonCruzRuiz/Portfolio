<h1>Here's A Website I Made For Fun</h1>
<p> Tic Tac Toe Is A Kinda Hard One To Code
    JavaScript Is The Most Annoying Code
And Tic-Tac-Toe Has Some History Around
    Games played on three-in-a-row
    boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt,
    where such game boards have been found
    on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC.
    An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire,
    around the first century BC. It was called terni lapilli
    (three pebbles at a time) and instead of having any number of pieces,
    each player had only three; thus, they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing.
    The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. Another closely related ancient game is three men's morris which is also played on a simple grid
    and requires three pieces in a row to finish, and Picaria, a game of the Puebloans. Here The Link To The Game:
