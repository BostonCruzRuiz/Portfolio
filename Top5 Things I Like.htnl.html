<p>I love all the movies and I know all of them saw is about the bathroom game. Saw 2 is about the nerve gas house game. Saw 3 is the gideon meatpacking plant game. Saw 4 is about the gideon meatpacking plant too but the game is very different. Saw 5 is the catacombs game with 5 people. Saw 6 is the Rowan Zoological Institute Game. Saw 7 also called Saw 3D is two games one is for the cops and the second one is a book writer. Saw 8 is also called Jigsaw this movies game is called the barn game. Saw 9 is also called Spiral: From The Book Of Saw. The new one is Saw X aka Saw 10 and the game is called Chemical Plant. And the new one coming soon is Saw 11 that is called Saw XI.</p>
